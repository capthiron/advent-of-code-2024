# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🦀

Welcome to **Advent of Code 2024**! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges, implemented in Rust. Get ready to dive into the holiday spirit with some coding fun! 🎁✨

## 🎅 Getting Started

To run the solutions for a specific day, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can install Rust from rust-lang.org.

## 🎁 Running the Solutions

This project includes a command-line interface to easily run the solution for any day. Simply use the following command:

```bash
cargo run <day>
```

Replace <day> with the day number you want to run (e.g., 1 for Day 1). For example:

```bash
cargo run 1
```

This will execute the solutions for Day 1 and display the results for both parts. 🎉

## 📂 Project Structure

- src/: Contains the Rust source files for each day's challenge.
- input/: Stores the input files for each day.
- Cargo.toml: Manages dependencies and project metadata.

## 🎄 Adding New Days

To add a new day's solution:

1. Create a new file in the src/ directory named dayXX.rs, where XX is the day number.
2. Implement the solution functions (solve_part1 and solve_part2) in the new file.
3. Add the module to main.rs and update the match statement to include the new day.

## 🎅 Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own solutions or improvements. Let's make this a collaborative and festive coding experience! 🤶🎉

## 🌟 Happy Coding!

May your days be merry and bright and may your code be bug-free! 🎄✨
