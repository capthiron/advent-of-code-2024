🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🦀
Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 project! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Rust. Get ready to dive into the holiday spirit with some coding fun! 🎁✨

🎅 Getting Started
To run the solutions for a specific day, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can install Rust from rust-lang.org.

🎁 Running the Solutions
This project includes a command-line interface to easily run the solution for any day. Simply use the following command:

cargo run <day>
Replace <day> with the day number you want to run (e.g., 1 for Day 1). For example:

cargo run 1
This will execute the solutions for Day 1 and display the results for both parts. 🎉

📂 Project Structure
src/: Contains the Rust source files for each day's challenge.
input/: Stores the input files for each day.
Cargo.toml: Manages dependencies and project metadata.
🎄 Adding New Days
To add a new day's solution:

Create a new file in the src/ directory named dayXX.rs, where XX is the day number.
Implement the solution functions (solve_part1 and solve_part2) in the new file.
Add the module to main.rs and update the match statement to include the new day.
🎅 Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own solutions or improvements. Let's make this a collaborative and festive coding experience! 🤶🎉

🌟 Happy Coding!
May your days be merry and bright and may your code be bug-free! 🎄✨
